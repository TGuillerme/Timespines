## Sensitivity Analysis
 * Effect of sample size (randomly resample - bootstrap style)
 * Effect of preservation:
 	* Resample using "selective preservation" (i.e. use only the head, body, tail)
 	* Resample using "random preservation" (i.e. bootstrap style on the body parts)
 	
Sensitivity analysis should be applied to fossil data? Definitely needs to be applied to extant data for a baseline estimation.
