# Details

### Species name
Lowest taxonomic level available
### Group
Just information for us for the general taxonomic group (i.e. class)
### Oldest Age (in Mya)
Oldest formation age 
### Youngest Age (in Mya) 
Youngest formation age 
### Environement
Either terrestrial or aquatic (i.e. does it swim or fly/walk)
### Source
Of the data!
### Body length (m)
Get the best estimate if incomplete but add the way it was estimated to a note file
### Body mass (kg)
Get the best estimate if incomplete but add the way it was estimated to a note file
### BM (source)
Source of the body mass (e.g. estimation from another paper, original paper, calculated by hand...)
### Diet (herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, small stuff eater)
Small stuff eater are things like insectivores, durophagy, filter/suspension feeding, etc...
### Head/Body/Tail presence (0/1)
Is the Head/Body/Tail fairly preserved in the fossil record.
### Head/Body/Tail projection (0/1/NA)
Does the Head/Body/Tail have any sort of discrete projections (e.g. spikes, horns, etc...)
### Head/Body/Tail surface (0/1/NA)
Does the Head/Body/Tail have any sort of surface protection (e.g. osteoderms, plates, etc...)
### Head/Body/Tail function (nothing/foraging/sexual/other/NA)
Does the Head/Body/Tail these surface or projections have any other purpose (suspected) than defense
### Notes
Use this one only for small notes (if none fill with NA). For longer notes like body measurements estimation, create a text file in the Notes folder in the Data folder named by the `species_name_formation.txt` (for example) specifying the notes/details.

# Folder organisation

All the raw data (just collected - unprocessed) is stored in the `Raw/` folder.

 * The collected data (finalised - not to be modified again) is in `Raw/Collected/`
 * The data still in collection (not finished yet) is in `Raw/Still_collecting/`
 * The trees used are in `Raw/Trees/`
 * `LaurenData` contains body length data and FAD/LAD for a lot of fishes
 * `Notes` contain notes on data collection. It will eventually be removed

All the processed data needs to be associated to a data script (in `Analysis/`) and saved in `Processed/`.
