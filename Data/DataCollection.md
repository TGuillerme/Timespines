If info not available or too hard to collect set NA for now

## Species name
Lowest taxonomic level available
## Group
Just information for us for the general taxonomic group (i.e. class)
## Oldest Age (in Mya)
Oldest formation age 
## Youngest Age (in Mya) 
Youngest formation age 
## Environement
Either terrestrial or aquatic (i.e. does it swim or fly/walk)
## Source
Of the data!
## Body length (m)
Get the best estimate if incomplete but add the way it was estimated to a note file
## Body mass (kg)
Get the best estimate if incomplete but add the way it was estimated to a note file
## BM (source)
Source of the body mass (e.g. estimation from another paper, original paper, calculated by hand...)
## Diet (herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, small stuff eater)
Small stuff eater are things like insectivores, durophagy, filter/suspension feeding, etc...
## Head/Body/Tail presence (0/1)
Is the Head/Body/Tail fairly preserved in the fossil record.
## Head/Body/Tail projection (0/1/NA)
Does the Head/Body/Tail have any sort of discrete projections (e.g. spikes, horns, etc...)
## Head/Body/Tail surface (0/1/NA)
Does the Head/Body/Tail have any sort of surface protection (e.g. osteoderms, plates, etc...)
## Head/Body/Tail function (nothing/foraging/sexual/other/NA)
Does the Head/Body/Tail these surface or projections have any other purpose (suspected) than defense
## Notes
Use this one only for small notes (if none fill with NA). For longer notes like body measurements estimation, create a text file in the Notes folder in the Data folder named by the `species_name_formation.txt` (for example) specifying the notes/details.
